# CSharpGame

A Game Engine built with C# using OpenTK

Usage:
use mklink /J in each game folder to link to the res folder that contains all the resources

```
 mklink /J "C:\engine\builds\debug\res" "C:\engine\res"
```

**Known Issues:**
- You can currently only have ONE shadow caster
- Batching sometimes moves objects to wrong positions, needs more testing

- General preformance and memory improvements required

**Future Plans:**
- More UI stuff like text, and clicking and stuff
- Editor
- Sound(3d and 2d) - IMPORTANT!
