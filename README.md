# MonoGameEngine
A Game Engine built with C# using OpenTK

Usage:
use mklink /J in each game folder to link to the res folder that contains all the resources

```
 mklink /J "C:\engine\builds\debug\res" "C:\engine\res"
```

**Known Issues:**
- Adding UI crashes the game

**Future Plans:**

- Shadow Mapping
- FXAA or other anti aliasing techniques
