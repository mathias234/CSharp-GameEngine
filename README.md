# CSharpGame

A Game Engine built with C# using OpenTK

Usage:
use mklink /J in each game folder to link to the res folder that contains all the resources

```
 mklink /J "C:\engine\builds\debug\res" "C:\engine\res"
```

**Current Work**
- General fixing, improvements, simplifing things. before i add any more features

**Known Issues:**
- You can currently only have ONE shadow caster

**Future Plans:**
- More UI stuff like text, and clicking and stuff
- Editor
- Sound(3d and 2d) - IMPORTANT!
- Better Object loading, like more formats and load materials from obj
